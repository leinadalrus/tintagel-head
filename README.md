###### *Production bolstered by a talented crew of zanies - another commedia dell'arte stock characterizer*

Experimental project in creating a basic UI in Raylib 4.5 for the sake of Digital Signal Processing and Audio Streaming/Handling.
  
`.cfg` and-or `.ini` files may also see some application in the future...

##### The general idea as-of-now...
* Currently using C++14 to create a far-more robust application audio backend.
* Develop a branching Action-Role-Playing Game to reinforce my software engineering fundamentals and learning materials.
* Recreate an old C++14/Rust project in order to further understand FFI-ing and be able to work with multiple technologies without bias(?)

###### Why the use of multiple languages?
    
 C++14 is also employed because I love C, alas C++ enables us to use OOP practices better to practice, 
  but I tend to shoot myself in the foot with it anyways, which is as to why am experimenting with new and old technologies.
    
Might in turn make this into a 'Type-fighter/ARPG' kinda project to make it a bit more coherent when invisioning the system.
